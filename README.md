# The Project
Our team is working together alongside the South Saskatchewan Community Foundation to create a website that functions as a resource hub with Charities and Non-Profit Organizations in mind. This project will compile all kinds of resources that help these Saskatchewan based organizations
succeed in their endeavors, eliminating the difficult task of having to search the web for these resources -- which are often difficult to find. These resources will all be specific to Saskatchewan, and will be a website that Charities and Non-Profit Organizations can visit with the reassurance
that the information they are getting is relevant to them and their cause.
This is the South Saskatchewan Community Foundation Resource Hub!
